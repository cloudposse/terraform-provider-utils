## Usage



Here is how to use this provider in your own Terraform code:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    utils = {
      source = "cloudposse/utils"
      version = ">= 1.17.0"
    }
  }
}
```

See the [Docs](./docs) for additional information.




## Examples

Here is an example of using this provider:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    utils = {
      source = "cloudposse/utils"
    }
  }
}

locals {
  yaml_data_1 = file("${path.module}/data1.yaml")
  yaml_data_2 = file("${path.module}/data2.yaml")
}

data "utils_deep_merge_yaml" "example" {
  input = [
    local.yaml_data_1,
    local.yaml_data_2
  ]
}

output "deep_merge_output" {
  value = data.utils_deep_merge_yaml.example.output
}
```

Here are some additional examples:

- [`examples/data-sources/utils_deep_merge_json`](examples/data-sources/utils_deep_merge_json)
- [`examples/data-sources/utils_deep_merge_yaml`](examples/data-sources/utils_deep_merge_yaml)



## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (see [Requirements](#requirements) above).

To compile the provider, run `go install`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

To generate or update documentation, run `go generate`.

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

_Note:_ Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
$ make testacc
```

### Testing Locally

You can test the provider locally by using the [provider_installation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/config/config-file.html#provider-installation) functionality.

For testing this provider, you can edit your `~/.terraformrc` file with the following:

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides  {
    "cloudposse/utils" = "/path/to/your/code/github.com/cloudposse/terraform-provider-utils/"
  }

  # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
  # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
  # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
  direct {}
}
```

With that in place, you can build the provider (see above) and add a provider block:

```hcl
required_providers {
    utils = {
      source = "cloudposse/utils"
    }
  }
```

Then run `terraform init`, `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` as normal.

```sh
$ terraform init

Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect

The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI configuration:
 - cloudposse/utils in /path/to/your/code/github.com/cloudposse/terraform-provider-utils

The behavior may therefore not match any released version of the provider and
applying changes may cause the state to become incompatible with published
releases.
```

```sh
terraform apply

Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect

The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI configuration:

- [Terraform Plugins](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/plugin-types.html#providers) - Terraform is logically split into two main parts: Terraform Core and Terraform Plugins. Each plugin exposes an implementation for a specific service, such as the AWS provider or the cloud-init provider.
