Terraform provider for various utilities (deep merging, Atmos stack configuration management), and to add additional missing functionality to Terraform


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).
>
> <details>
> <summary><strong>Watch demo of using Atmos with Terraform</strong></summary>
> <img src="https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/blob/main/docs/demo.gif?raw=true"/><br/>
> <i>Example of running <a href="https://atmos.tools"><code>atmos</code></a> to manage infrastructure from our <a href="https://atmos.tools/quick-start/">Quick Start</a> tutorial.</i>
> </detalis>





## Usage

Here is how to use this provider in your own Terraform code:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    utils = {
      source = "cloudposse/utils"
      version = ">= 1.17.0"
    }
  }
}
```

See the [Docs](./docs) for additional information.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.





## Examples

Here is an example of using this provider:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    utils = {
      source = "cloudposse/utils"
    }
  }
}

locals {
  yaml_data_1 = file("${path.module}/data1.yaml")
  yaml_data_2 = file("${path.module}/data2.yaml")
}

data "utils_deep_merge_yaml" "example" {
  input = [
    local.yaml_data_1,
    local.yaml_data_2
  ]
}

output "deep_merge_output" {
  value = data.utils_deep_merge_yaml.example.output
}
```

Here are some additional examples:

- [`examples/data-sources/utils_deep_merge_json`](examples/data-sources/utils_deep_merge_json)
- [`examples/data-sources/utils_deep_merge_yaml`](examples/data-sources/utils_deep_merge_yaml)








## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (see [Requirements](#requirements) above).

Install [atmos](https://atmos.tools/install)

To compile the provider, run `go install`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

To generate or update documentation, run `go generate`.

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `atmos testacc`.

_Note:_ Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
$ atmos testacc
```

### Testing Locally

You can test the provider locally by using the [provider_installation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/config/config-file.html#provider-installation) functionality.

For testing this provider, you can edit your `~/.terraformrc` file with the following:

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides  {
    "cloudposse/utils" = "/path/to/your/code/github.com/cloudposse/terraform-provider-utils/"
  }

  # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
  # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
  # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
  direct {}
}
```

With that in place, you can build the provider (see above) and add a provider block:

```hcl
required_providers {
    utils = {
      source = "cloudposse/utils"
    }
  }
```

Then run `terraform init`, `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` as normal.

```sh
$ terraform init

Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect

The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI configuration:
 - cloudposse/utils in /path/to/your/code/github.com/cloudposse/terraform-provider-utils

The behavior may therefore not match any released version of the provider and
applying changes may cause the state to become incompatible with published
releases.
```

```sh
terraform apply

Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect

The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI configuration:

The behavior may therefore not match any released version of the provider and
